        Oh, you're curious to learn more about me? No need to mention it â€” I was

        Ooops, where are my manners? Sorry! I'm Dan, a guy pasionate about
        frontend development.

        <p>
          My introduction to programming dates back to elementary school, where
          we used to tinker and play around with Turbo Pascal. That's how this
          exciting journey began.

          Part 2 of this saga continued in high school with C++. Part 3 was
          during my university years. It started with C++ again but the plot
          thickened. This time we got additional episodes featuring Java, C#,
          JavaScript, HTML, CSS and jQuery. The season concluded with the
          attainment of a bachelor's degree and a promising bright future.

          Well, well... the tutorial reached its conclusion, and it was time to
          venture into the 'open world'. The adventure started out as a
          full-stack developer, but then transitioned to frontend development
          due to my meticulous and organized work style. I've contributed to
          diverse projects spanning industries like real estate, insurance,
          plumbing, e-learning, food and beverage, literature, restaurants, and
          job platforms.

          <b>Spoiler alert!</b> Season 2, Part 2 is currently in development,
          and I'm on the lookout to fill a key role. Below, you'll discover a
          list of technologies I'm comfortable with, and for a sneak peek at my
          personal projects, head over to the About Page.

        <p>
          P.S. I'm also open to exploring backend development in the future.
